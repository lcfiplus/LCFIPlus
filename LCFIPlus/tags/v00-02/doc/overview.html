<h2>LCFIPlus documentation</h2>

The LCFIPlus package provides a collection of algorithms for performing
vertex finding, jet clustering, and flavor tagging
in the context of a future linear collider, such as the ILC and CLIC.

This package extends the features originally developed by
<a href="http://ilcsoft.desy.de/portal/software_packages/lcfivertex/">LCFIVertex</a>.

This project is part of

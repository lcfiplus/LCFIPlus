-------------
| v00-05-02 |
-------------
- Fixed type conversion error in track hits
- Added option to choose track hit ordering
- Vertex-jet reassociation no longer throws exception to cope with
  cases of dropped tracks when running kt algorithm before LCFIPlus

-------------
| v00-05-01 |
-------------
- Improved steering options thanks to P.Roloff
  1) The magnetic field can be specified (default behavior is to read from GEAR).
	2) The beam constraint in the primary vertex fit can be switched off.
	3) The beam size can be adjusted.
	4) The cuts on the number of hits to calculate jointProbD0 and jointProbZ0,
	and to find the most significant track can now be adjusted.

----------
| v00-05 |
----------
- vertex-assisted jet clustering now adjustable with vertex pairing penalties
- flavor tagging input variables added
- can apply preselections to samples used in training

----------
| v00-04 |
----------
- lcfiplus processor should work with multiple instances
- single track pseudo-vertex added
- jet vertex refiner algorithm added
- improved v0 rejection
- new flavor tagging variables + various bug fixes
- updated steering files

-- history end

-- algorithms
(1) PrimaryVertexFinder  Reconstructing primary vertex by tear-down method
(2) BuildUpVertex        Reconstructing secondary vertices by build-up method
(3) JetClustering        Reconstructing jets with vertex information
(4) JetVertexRefiner     Single track vertex finder + vertex combiner
(5) FlavorTag            Deriving variables to be used in flavor tag MVA
(6) MakeNtuple           Making root files with FlavorTag variables for training
(7) TrainMVA             Training MVA with root files
(8) ReadMVA              Obtaining flavor tag results with training weight files
-- algorithms end

-- sample steering files
(a) vertex.xml            (1-2), for DST production
(b) jetclustering.xml     (3-4), for non-flavor-tag applications
(c) vertexjet.xml         (1-4), vertex finder + jet clustering
(d) makentuple.xml        (3-6), making training sample from DST
(e) makentuplefrompfo.xml (1-6), vertex finder + (d)
(f) makentuplefromjet.xml (5-6), for tuning MVA variables from samples after (b)/(c)
(g) train.xml             (7), for training using result of (d-f)
(h) flavortag.xml         (3-5,8), for flavor tagging from DST
(i) flavortagfrompfo.xml  (1-5,8), vertex finder + (h)
-- sample steering files end

-- easy usage
*** obtaining flavor tag outputs with existing training files
 Just run (h)flavortag.xml with replacing input/output files and training files
 (for samples before vertex finding, run (i) instead)

*** obtaining flavor tag outputs with original training files
 (A) Run (d)makentuple.xml on training samples to use .root files (b-sample/c-sample/q-sample)
     (for samples before vertex finding, run (e) instead)
 (B) Run (g)train.xml with the .root files created in (A)
 (C) Run (h)flavortag.xml with the weight files created in (B)
     (for samples before vertex finding, run (i) instead)
